I ruined a couple of castles back in college* But nowadays I prefer to stay in my cave.* I used to go out to corrupt the minds of the innocent*Or I'd go out to eat a virgin every full moon or so*But The innocent are so rare these days.*Not to mention the virgins!

ehm...*Yes...*Phenex and Orobas*They're both massive A-holes*Whenever I called Orobas he'd just insult me so much!*Then he'd say "Oh but I'm a truth teller!"*Like that's an excuse!*And Phenex is one of those annoying monsters who just can't do anything wrong!*He'll pretend to be nice to your face*But then you find out he cut off your tail while you were sleeping!
