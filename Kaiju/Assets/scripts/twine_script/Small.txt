...*It's my height, isn't it?!*It's always the same*Nobody wants to date a Kaiju who's below 300 ft*It's a frickin obsession!*Ain't I big enough to crush a building?!*It's not the size that matters*It's the fury and destruction!*What about you?*What's the most impressive place you've destroyed?

I know I can seem tough*But I'm really quite the romantic!*I know how to treat a monster!*I'd massage your tentacles after a long day of destruction*I'd surprice you with pickled germans on a regular Tuesday*That's just the kind of monster I am*What about you?

[[I'm not really into that stuff...%-1|S06]]

Seems a bit cliche if you ask me.* That place is so trashy you can barely tell someone's been destroying it*And the buildings are ridiculously tall!*If you could eat any human dead or alive*Who would it be?

That's Awesome!* I know it's a small country*But it's still a whole country you destroyed!*That makes you pretty cool in my book!*Size doesn't matter!

[[I think it does...%-1|S10]]
[[Thanks! you're right!%1|S09]]

Always the same!*They only want the bad monsters*It doesn't matter that you're a genuine and nice monster who would do anything for their mate*If a huge dinosaur kaiju shows up and spits lazer down their throats*That's the idiot they want.*I was hoping you would be different...

[[I am different!%1|S09]]
[[Is this big lazer spitting monster someone you know?%-1|S10]]

You do look like a classy monster!*I just knew you would get me*wearing that bowtie!*I get so mad at idiot monsters who can't appreciate a good thing!*They're all slugs!*No offence...*so ehm*If you could eat any human dead or alive*Who would it be?

You're a really special Kaiju!*I feel like I already know you*!*I've had so much bad luck on these dating apps.*But something about you and that cute bowtie made me optimistic!

[[Wanna go back to my cave and get even more optimistic?%0|END]]

I can't believe it!*What is it with you size obsessed kaijus?!*Would it hurt to just consider going out with a different sized monster?*Us bug mutants are really frickin big compared to the creatures we once came from!*But you never hear anyone talking about that!

[[Maybe things can grow between us back at my cave?%0|END]]
